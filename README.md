[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/45488ec7-bb7a-4c13-92f9-d35082a82922/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cosy-hugo-theme/deploys)

An accessibility-friendly Hugo theme, based on the [Cupper theme](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme) ported from the [original Cupper](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/cupper) project.

Please note that this is my personal fork to scratch my own itches with Hugo themes. Please read the Cupper theme documentation first. I'm happy to take feedback and suggested changes, although I can't promise that I'll want to incorporate them.

## Demo

## Minimum Hugo version

Hugo version `0.60.1` or higher is required. View the [Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and download the binary for your OS.

## Credits

Thank you [Heydon Pickering](http://www.heydonworks.com) and [The Paciello Group](https://www.paciellogroup.com/) for creating the original Cupper project, and to Zachary Betz for adapting Cupper into a Hugo theme.
