# Cosy

An accessibility-friendly Hugo theme, based on the [Cupper theme](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme) ported from the [original Cupper](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/cupper) project.

This is my personal fork to scratch my own itches with Hugo themes. Please read the Cupper theme documentation first.

## Demo

https://cosy-hugo-theme.netlify.app/

## Minimum Hugo version

Hugo version `0.60.1` or higher is required. View the [Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and download the binary for your OS.

## Credits

Thank you [Heydon Pickering](http://www.heydonworks.com) and [The Paciello Group](https://www.paciellogroup.com/) for creating the original Cupper project, and to Zachary Betz for adapting Cupper into a Hugo theme.
